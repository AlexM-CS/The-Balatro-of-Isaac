This document specifies how card configs are written in this mod.
If a keyword exists inside an item's config, such as chips or mult,
it will always be in the specified location. I'll try to keep the order
in mind as well.

Any special behavior is controlled using the "special" table IFF
it must be separate for some reason. The special table is only used for
Vanilla Jokers if they need it to function with one of the modded cards,
but otherwise no Vanilla Jokers will have a special table.

config = {
    extra_value (might change when I do Vanilla reworks)
    
    extra = {
        h_size          (hands)
        d_size          (discards)
        size            (hand size)
        chips           (chips)
        mult            (mult)
        s_mult          (suit-dependent mult)
        suit            (suit)
        t_mult          (hand type-dependent mult)
        type            (hand type)
        Xmult           (times mult)
        odds            (probability)
        repetitions     (retriggers)
        dollars         (money)
    }

    special = {
        multiplier

        target
        targets = {
            first
            second
            third
            ...
        }
