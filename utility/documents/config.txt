This document specifies how card configs are written in this mod.
If a keyword exists inside an item's config, such as chips or mult,
it will always be in the specified location. I'll try to keep the order
in mind as well.

Any special behavior is controlled using the "special" table IFF
it must be separate for some reason.

config = {
    extra_value (might change when I do Vanilla reworks)
    
    extra = {
        h_size
        d_size
        chips
        mult
        Xmult
        odds
        repetitions
        money
    }

    special = {
        target
        targets = {
            first
            second
            third
            ...
        }

        flies
        spiders

        temp

        amount_chips
        amount_mult
        stored

        add
        subtract

        levels

        duplicate
    }
}
