This document specifies how card configs are written in this mod.
If a keyword exists inside an item's config, such as chips or mult,
it will always be in the specified location. I'll try to keep the order
in mind as well.

Any special behavior is controlled using the "special" table IFF
it must be separate for some reason. The special table is only used for
Vanilla Jokers if they need it to function with one of the modded cards,
but otherwise no Vanilla Jokers will have a special table.

config = {
    extra_value (might change when I do Vanilla reworks)
    
    extra = {
        h_size          (hand size)
        h_plays         (hands)
        d_size          (discards)
        size            (hand size)
        chips           (chips)
        chip_mod        (chips gain)
        Xchips          (times chips)
        upgrade         (permanent chips bonus)
        mult            (mult)
        mult_gain       (mult gain)
        s_mult          (suit-dependent mult)
        suit            (suit)
        t_mult          (hand type-dependent mult)
        type            (hand type)
        Xmult           (times mult)
        odds            (probability. Any variation of 'odds' goes in extra as well)
        repetitions     (retriggers)
        dollars         (money)
        sell_cost       (extra value)
        hands_left      (hands until this is destroyed)
        
        max_highlighted (highlight limit)
        cards           (num cards to effect)
        destroy         (num cards to destroy)
        create          (num cards to create)
        mod_conv        (enhancements)
